Putin jailed? Fake AI images spread onlineARIJETA LAJKA and PHILIP MARCELOMarch 23, 2023Updated: March 23, 2023 2:16 p.m.\\n\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nEmail\\n\\nComments\\n\\n NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump getting gang-tackled by riot-gear-clad New York City police officers. Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell.\\nThe highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.\\n But neither visual is remotely real. The images — and scores of variations littering social media — were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence.\\n\\n Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society.\\n“It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,” said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. “You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting.”\\nWhile the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn’t new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney, DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.\\nSome of the recent images have been driven by this month's release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.\\nIn one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.\\nThe visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.\\nHiggins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.\\nStill, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.\\n“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”\\nHe pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.\\nBut it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state in their posts that the images are AI-generated and solely for entertainment, says Shirin Anlen, media technologist at Witness, a New York-based human rights organization that focuses on visual evidence.\\nToo often, the visuals are quickly reshared by others without that crucial context, she said. Indeed, an Instagram post sharing some of Higgins' images o...</td>\n",

Fake AI images spread onlineImages created by Eliot Higgins with the use of artificial intelligence show a fictitious skirmish with former President Donald Trump and New York City police officers posted on Higgins' Twitter account, as photographed on an iPhone in Arlington, Va., Thursday, Mar. 23, 2023. The highly detailed, sensational images, which are not real, were produced using a sophisticated and widely accessible image generator.(AP Photo/J. David Ake)By The Associated PressPublished: Mar. 23, 2023 at 1:25 PM CDT|Updated: 1 hour agoShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInNEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump getting gang-tackled by riot-gear-clad New York City police officers. Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell.The highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.But neither visual is remotely real. The images — and scores of variations littering social media — were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence.Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society.“It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,” said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. “You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting.”As the drama surrounding Trump reaches a fever pitch, the waiting game continues for a possible indictment. (CNN, POOL, ABC, WCBS, MSNBC, STORMY DANIELS)While the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn’t new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney, DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.Some of the recent images have been driven by this month’s release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.In one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.The visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.Higgins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.Still, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”He pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.But it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state...</td>\n",

Fake AI images spread onlineARIJETA LAJKA and PHILIP MARCELOMarch 23, 2023Updated: March 23, 2023 2:16 p.m.\\n\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nEmail\\n\\nComments\\n\\n NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump getting gang-tackled by riot-gear-clad New York City police officers. Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell.\\nThe highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.\\n But neither visual is remotely real. The images — and scores of variations littering social media — were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence.\\n\\n Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society.\\n“It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,” said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. “You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting.”\\nWhile the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn’t new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney, DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.\\nSome of the recent images have been driven by this month's release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.\\nIn one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.\\nThe visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.\\nHiggins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.\\nStill, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.\\n“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”\\nHe pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.\\nBut it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state in their posts that the images are AI-generated and solely for entertainment, says Shirin Anlen, media technologist at Witness, a New York-based human rights organization that focuses on visual evidence.\\nToo often, the visuals are quickly reshared by others without that crucial context, she said. Indeed, an Instagram post sharing some of Higgins' images o...   \n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell.The highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.But neither visual is remotely real. The images — and scores of variations littering social media — were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence.Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society.“It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,” said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. “You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting.”As the drama surrounding Trump reaches a fever pitch, the waiting game continues for a possible indictment. (CNN, POOL, ABC, WCBS, MSNBC, STORMY DANIELS)While the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn’t new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney, DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.Some of the recent images have been driven by this month’s release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.In one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.The visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.Higgins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.Still, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”He pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.But it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state...   \n",

David Ake)By The Associated PressPublished: Mar. 23, 2023 at 1:25 PM CDT|Updated: 1 hour agoShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInNEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump getting gang-tackled by riot-gear-clad New York City police officers. Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell.The highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.But neither visual is remotely real. The images — and scores of variations littering social media — were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence.Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society.“It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,” said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. “You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting.”As the drama surrounding Trump reaches a fever pitch, the waiting game continues for a possible indictment. (CNN, POOL, ABC, WCBS, MSNBC, STORMY DANIELS)While the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn’t new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney, DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.Some of the recent images have been driven by this month’s release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.In one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.The visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.Higgins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.Still, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”He pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.But it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state...</td>\n",

They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.Some of the recent images have been driven by this month's release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.In one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.The visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.Story continuesHiggins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.Still, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”He pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.But it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state in their posts that the images are AI-generated and solely for entertainment, says Shirin Anlen, media technologist at Witness, a New York-based human rights organization that focuses on visual evidence.Too often, the visuals are quickly reshared by others without that crucial context, she said. Indeed, an Instagram post sharing some of Higgins' images of Trump as if they were genuine garnered more than 79,000 likes.“You’re just seeing an image, and once you see something, you cannot unsee it,” Anlen said.In another recent example, social media users shared a synthetic image supposedly capturing Putin kneeling and kissing the hand of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The image, which circulated as the Russian president welcomed Xi to the Kremli...   \n",

The multi-function device can be used as an autonomous personal AI camera, as a handheld 3-axis AI camera, also a high-performance drone. In launching the PowerEgg X, PowerVision has created an entirely new product classification, the all-in-one autonomous personal AI camera category.\\nEditor Note: Power Vision will exhibit at The International Consumer Electronics Show which runs from January 7-10, 2020, at the Las Vegas Convention Center in the South Hall, booth #26415.\\n\\n\\nThe instant-sharing PowerEgg X fills consumers’ demand for an all-in-one, smarter, easier-to-use, versatile, portable, cost-effective camera that, oh by the way, can also fly. It is equipped with a 4k/60fps HD camcorder with a three-axis gimbal. It produces professional quality images, whether it is used as an AI camera, handheld gimbal camera or a drone. All of this, in an IPX6 rated waterproof case that will be demonstrated at CES 2020 in our drone cage with a waterfall.\\n\\n\\n“‘Innovate the Future’ is our mission and innovation is in our DNA,” said Wally Zheng, Founder and CEO of PowerVision. “Three years in development, PowerEgg X pulls together the technology consumers are seeking and puts it in a small, elegant egg shape. With smart-image recognition tracking, image mechanical stabilization, and simple video-editing tools, it is easy for anyone to shoot material as if they were a professional-grade videographer. By creating a multi-purpose device, PowerVision has reduced the user’s total purchase cost, storage requirement, increased ease-of-use, and giving the user unprecedented convenience.”\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Personal AI Camera Mode\\n\\n\\nWith the help of its powerful proprietary AI algorithm and robotics technology capabilities, the PowerEgg X enables facial recognition, deep learning, and a tracking field of view up to 170°. Subjects will always be in the middle of the video frame, even if the subject is playing sports, dancing, or running.\\n\\n\\nA unique spotlight feature automatically remembers a subject, allowing the PowerEgg X to track it, even if the subject moves in and out of the field of view. It also allows users to take a photo, record video, track movements, and capture a group photo by merely making gestures that are based on a deep-learning massive gesture database.\\n\\n\\nHandheld Gimbal Camera Mode\\n\\n\\nWhen switched into the handheld mode, the PowerEgg X captures all of life’s beautiful moments – anytime, anywhere – using its three-axis mechanical-stability augmentation gimbal and Autonomous Personal AI camera. It has a battery life of 3.5 hours and produces 4K/60fps UHD images while its three-axis gimbal helps resist vibration caused by external factors. PowerEgg X’s anti-shake feature outperforms optical image stabilization used in ordinary photography, guaranteeing superior, high-quality pictures.\\n\\n\\nDrone Mode\\n\\n\\nThe PowerEgg X is a high-performance drone equipped with a 4K/60fps camera and tri-axial mechanical stability augmentation technologies, and it can be used for highly dynamic aerial photography. It is capable of flying in winds of up to 29-38 knots. It comes with waterproof accessories (waterproof case and landing float) that enable it to take off from and land on water, which is a first of its kind in the industry. It also performs well in heavy rain and other scenarios, such as aquatic events and at-sea rescue operations.\\n\\nThe PowerVision PowerEgg X is the world’s first consumer drone that can pick up sound. Its proprietary SyncVoice technology allows users to narrate in real-time by using their mobile phone’s microphone or a wireless earphone. The narration is then automatically synchronized with pictures, effectively ending silent-aerial photography. It works for up to 30 minutes in drone mode and features automatic obstacle avoidance...</td>\n",

We’re excited and inspired to see our work being recognized by CB Insights.”\\n\\n\\nKneron’s on-device edge AI solutions include AI chips and AI software models that enhance smart devices with AI functions without the constant need to be connected to a cloud-based AI service because the AI inferencing happens where the data is collected. This greatly reduces the bandwidth needed to share vast amounts of private user data to be computed and stored in cloud servers and the possibility that the data can be compromised, leaked, or hacked.\\n\\n\\nWith real solutions being employed by partners in the market already, Kneron is pioneering the growth of the on-device edge AI industry.\\n\\n\\n“It’s been remarkable to see the success of the companies named to the Artificial Intelligence 100 over the last four years. The 2019 AI 100 saw 48 companies go on to raise $4.9B of additional financing and nine got acquired,” said CB Insights CEO Anand Sanwal. “It has been gratifying to see that CB Insights’ data-driven approach to identifying the top AI companies using patents, customer traction, investor quality, market sizing and more has become so effective at picking the AI winners of tomorrow. We look forward to seeing what the 2020 AI 100 companies will accomplish over the course of this year and beyond.”\\n\\n\\nThrough an evidence-based approach, the CB Insights research team selected the AI 100 from nearly 5,000 companies based on several factors including patent activity, investor quality, news sentiment analysis, proprietary Mosaic scores, market potential, partnerships, competitive landscape, team strength, and tech novelty. The Mosaic Score, based on CB Insights’ algorithm, measures the overall health and growth potential of private companies to help predict a company’s momentum.\\n\\n\\nAbout Kneron\\n\\nKneron, established in San Diego in 2015, is a leading provider of on-device edge AI solutions.

In launching the PowerEgg X, PowerVision has created an entirely new product classification, the all-in-one autonomous personal AI camera category.\\nEditor Note: Power Vision will exhibit at The International Consumer Electronics Show which runs from January 7-10, 2020, at the Las Vegas Convention Center in the South Hall, booth #26415.\\n\\n\\nThe instant-sharing PowerEgg X fills consumers’ demand for an all-in-one, smarter, easier-to-use, versatile, portable, cost-effective camera that, oh by the way, can also fly. It is equipped with a 4k/60fps HD camcorder with a three-axis gimbal. It produces professional quality images, whether it is used as an AI camera, handheld gimbal camera or a drone. All of this, in an IPX6 rated waterproof case that will be demonstrated at CES 2020 in our drone cage with a waterfall.\\n\\n\\n“‘Innovate the Future’ is our mission and innovation is in our DNA,” said Wally Zheng, Founder and CEO of PowerVision. “Three years in development, PowerEgg X pulls together the technology consumers are seeking and puts it in a small, elegant egg shape. With smart-image recognition tracking, image mechanical stabilization, and simple video-editing tools, it is easy for anyone to shoot material as if they were a professional-grade videographer. By creating a multi-purpose device, PowerVision has reduced the user’s total purchase cost, storage requirement, increased ease-of-use, and giving the user unprecedented convenience.”\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Personal AI Camera Mode\\n\\n\\nWith the help of its powerful proprietary AI algorithm and robotics technology capabilities, the PowerEgg X enables facial recognition, deep learning, and a tracking field of view up to 170°. Subjects will always be in the middle of the video frame, even if the subject is playing sports, dancing, or running.\\n\\n\\nA unique spotlight feature automatically remembers a subject, allowing the PowerEgg X to track it, even if the subject moves in and out of the field of view. It also allows users to take a photo, record video, track movements, and capture a group photo by merely making gestures that are based on a deep-learning massive gesture database.\\n\\n\\nHandheld Gimbal Camera Mode\\n\\n\\nWhen switched into the handheld mode, the PowerEgg X captures all of life’s beautiful moments – anytime, anywhere – using its three-axis mechanical-stability augmentation gimbal and Autonomous Personal AI camera. It has a battery life of 3.5 hours and produces 4K/60fps UHD images while its three-axis gimbal helps resist vibration caused by external factors. PowerEgg X’s anti-shake feature outperforms optical image stabilization used in ordinary photography, guaranteeing superior, high-quality pictures.\\n\\n\\nDrone Mode\\n\\n\\nThe PowerEgg X is a high-performance drone equipped with a 4K/60fps camera and tri-axial mechanical stability augmentation technologies, and it can be used for highly dynamic aerial photography. It is capable of flying in winds of up to 29-38 knots. It comes with waterproof accessories (waterproof case and landing float) that enable it to take off from and land on water, which is a first of its kind in the industry. It also performs well in heavy rain and other scenarios, such as aquatic events and at-sea rescue operations.\\n\\nThe PowerVision PowerEgg X is the world’s first consumer drone that can pick up sound. Its proprietary SyncVoice technology allows users to narrate in real-time by using their mobile phone’s microphone or a wireless earphone. The narration is then automatically synchronized with pictures, effectively ending silent-aerial photography. It works for up to 30 minutes in drone mode and features automatic obstacle avoidance...   \n",

We’re excited and inspired to see our work being recognized by CB Insights.”\\n\\n\\nKneron’s on-device edge AI solutions include AI chips and AI software models that enhance smart devices with AI functions without the constant need to be connected to a cloud-based AI service because the AI inferencing happens where the data is collected. This greatly reduces the bandwidth needed to share vast amounts of private user data to be computed and stored in cloud servers and the possibility that the data can be compromised, leaked, or hacked.\\n\\n\\nWith real solutions being employed by partners in the market already, Kneron is pioneering the growth of the on-device edge AI industry.\\n\\n\\n“It’s been remarkable to see the success of the companies named to the Artificial Intelligence 100 over the last four years. The 2019 AI 100 saw 48 companies go on to raise $4.9B of additional financing and nine got acquired,” said CB Insights CEO Anand Sanwal. “It has been gratifying to see that CB Insights’ data-driven approach to identifying the top AI companies using patents, customer traction, investor quality, market sizing and more has become so effective at picking the AI winners of tomorrow. We look forward to seeing what the 2020 AI 100 companies will accomplish over the course of this year and beyond.”\\n\\n\\nThrough an evidence-based approach, the CB Insights research team selected the AI 100 from nearly 5,000 companies based on several factors including patent activity, investor quality, news sentiment analysis, proprietary Mosaic scores, market potential, partnerships, competitive landscape, team strength, and tech novelty. The Mosaic Score, based on CB Insights’ algorithm, measures the overall health and growth potential of private companies to help predict a company’s momentum.\\n\\n\\nAbout Kneron\\n\\nKneron, established in San Diego in 2015, is a leading provider of on-device edge AI solutions. It is dedicated to the design and development of integrated software and hardware solutions for the smart home, smart surveillance, smartphones, personal computers, robots, drones, and other IoT devices.

Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)\\n\\n\\tThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n\\tAs the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n\\tWith the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n\\t“This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n\\t“Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n\\tThe company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\\n\\n\\tTraditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n\\tSuch problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tEach set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n\\tThe most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n\\t“For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.\\n\\n\\tOnce the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.\\n\\n\\tBesides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n\\tSo far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking indus...</td>\n",

Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)\\n\\n\\tThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n\\tAs the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n\\tWith the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n\\t“This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n\\t“Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n\\tThe company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\\n\\n\\tTraditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n\\tSuch problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tEach set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n\\tThe most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n\\t“For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.\\n\\n\\tOnce the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.\\n\\n\\tBesides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n\\tSo far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking indus...  \\\n",

Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)\\n\\n\\tThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n\\tAs the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n\\tWith the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n\\t“This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n\\t“Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n\\tThe company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\\n\\n\\tTraditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n\\tSuch problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tEach set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n\\tThe most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n\\t“For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.\\n\\n\\tOnce the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.\\n\\n\\tBesides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n\\tSo far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking indus...

Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. (People’s Daily Online/Li Wenming)\\n\\n\\tThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, China’s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.\\n\\n\\tAs the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.\\n\\n\\tWith the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.\\n\\n\\t“This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time,” recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.\\n\\n\\t“Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider,” Wang said.\\n\\n\\tThe smart roadside ETC system “AIpark Sky Eye” adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.\\n\\n\\tThe company’s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country’s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\\n\\n\\tTraditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.\\n\\n\\tSuch problems don’t exist in smart machines. The “AIpark Sky Eye” system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.\\n\\n\\tEach set of cameras of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.\\n\\n\\tThe most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.\\n\\n\\t“For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians,” Xiang said.\\n\\n\\tOnce the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the “AIpark Sky Eye” system.\\n\\n\\tBesides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.\\n\\n\\tSo far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking indus...

       "      <td>Artificial improves parking efficiency in Chinese cities People s Daily We Are , March , Home Artificial improves parking efficiency in Chinese citiesBy Liu Shiyao People s Daily , March , Photo taken on July , , shows a sign for electronic toll collection ETC newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July , . People s Daily Online Li to the application of an artificial AI empowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, China s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding percent.With the AI empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away. This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing. Since the summer of , roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing based leading smart parking solution provider.The company s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in by China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems don t exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for hours a day. The data collected by front end cameras are processed using multi dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the package of the system is precision brought about by high mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes. For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the high mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, high mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic . The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than cities in China, signaling important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development for smart parking industry.

According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between and seven years previous, and performed space themed video games with the robotic virtually day by day.As Kiwi was once fitted with machine learning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly.The authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary.Cameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from to on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with accuracy. That was once in spite of possible akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute.Lead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on. Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the setting. This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for real time recognition and response to in order to re engage the child to continue with the educational and or therapeutic activity, he stated.From left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with co authors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Matari s interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic.Haotian maiAround one in youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction ASD, can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as other folks. While therapists may give products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots.Co author Maja Matari Maja J Matari, outstanding professor of pc science, , and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR socially assistive robotics for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and non threatening. Jain stated Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to acknowledge and reply to human conduct, in ordinary customers and real world settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI human robot interaction capacity in the past unexplored within the context of long term, in home SAR for youngsters with ASD.

       "0                   Artificial improves parking efficiency in Chinese cities People s Daily We Are , March , Home Artificial improves parking efficiency in Chinese citiesBy Liu Shiyao People s Daily , March , Photo taken on July , , shows a sign for electronic toll collection ETC newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July , . People s Daily Online Li to the application of an artificial AI empowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, China s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding percent.With the AI empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away. This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing. Since the summer of , roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing based leading smart parking solution provider.The company s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in by China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems don t exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for hours a day. The data collected by front end cameras are processed using multi dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the package of the system is precision brought about by high mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes. For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the high mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, high mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic . The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than cities in China, signaling important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development for smart parking industry.

       "1  Children With Autism Saw Their Learning and Social Skills Boosted After Playing With This AI Robot News Parliament Skip to , February , Latest in conferences How can we get him to forestall Drax power station to cease burning coal in March Coronavirus Could Explode in the U.S. Overnight Like it Did in Dettol sales surge as markets fall againLevi Strauss marks the next phase in corporate paid leave the Real Story World Children With Autism Saw Their Learning and Social Skills Boosted After Playing With This AI Robot February , February , admin Comments Author Recent Posts admin Latest posts by admin see all in conferences How can we get him to forestall February , Coronavirus Could Explode in the U.S. Overnight Like it Did in Italy February , Levi Strauss marks the next phase in corporate paid leave policies February , Scientists who designed an clever robotic that helped youngsters with autism spice up their studying and social talents hope such era may just in the future help others with the dysfunction.The learn about noticed seven youngsters with gentle to average autism take domestic what s referred to as a socially assistive robotic, named Kiwi, for a month. According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between and seven years previous, and performed space themed video games with the robotic virtually day by day.As Kiwi was once fitted with machine learning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly.The authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary.Cameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from to on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with accuracy. That was once in spite of possible akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute.Lead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on. Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the setting. This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for real time recognition and response to in order to re engage the child to continue with the educational and or therapeutic activity, he stated.From left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with co authors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Matari s interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic.Haotian maiAround one in youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction ASD, can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as other folks. While therapists may give products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots.Co author Maja Matari Maja J Matari, outstanding professor of pc science, , and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR socially assistive robotics for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and non threatening. Jain stated Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to acknowledge and reply to human conduct, in ordinary customers and real world settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI human robot interaction capacity in the past unexplored within the context of long term, in home SAR for youngsters with ASD.

       "      <td>Artificial improves parking efficiency in Chinese cities People s Daily We Are , March , Home Artificial improves parking efficiency in Chinese citiesBy Liu Shiyao People s Daily , March , Photo taken on July , , shows a sign for electronic toll collection ETC newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July , . People s Daily Online Li to the application of an artificial AI empowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, China s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding percent.With the AI empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away. This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing. Since the summer of , roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing based leading smart parking solution provider.The company s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in by China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems don t exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for hours a day. The data collected by front end cameras are processed using multi dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the package of the system is precision brought about by high mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes. For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the high mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, high mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic . The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than cities in China, signaling important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development for smart parking industry.

       "0  Artificial improves parking efficiency in Chinese cities People s Daily We Are , March , Home Artificial improves parking efficiency in Chinese citiesBy Liu Shiyao People s Daily , March , Photo taken on July , , shows a sign for electronic toll collection ETC newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July , . People s Daily Online Li to the application of an artificial AI empowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, China s capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding percent.With the AI empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away. This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing. Since the summer of , roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing based leading smart parking solution provider.The company s intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the country s innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in by China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems don t exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for hours a day. The data collected by front end cameras are processed using multi dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the package of the system is precision brought about by high mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes. For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the high mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, high mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic . The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than cities in China, signaling important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development for smart parking industry.
